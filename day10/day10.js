//1.Conditional Operators
//Equality

let a=10;
let b=10;
console.log(a==b);
// Inequality  a!=b
// Greater than Operator  a>b
// Less than Operator   a<b
// Greater than Or Equal to  a>=b
// Less than or Equal to     a<=b


// 2.Logical Operators

// AND operator  && check if both are true
// OR operator  || check if one is true 
// NOT operator  ! general not operator
